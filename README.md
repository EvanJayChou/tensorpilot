# TensorPilot: Multi-Agentic AI System for Complex Mathematical Reasoning

This open-sourced research project investigates the use of multi-agent frameworks for agent orchestration and task delegation. Each agent is integrated into an AutoGen Group Chat, where each agent leverages different math engines, APIs, visualization tools, etc. to analyze and compute college-level mathematic questions ranging from calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations.

**Key Highlights**

- Agentic RAG is incorporated as an AutoGen agent and fetches documents with math proofs and formula sheets
- Math agents converse with each other to break down and solve a user query
- Memory retrievals based on previously solved problems further contextualize the RAG agent
